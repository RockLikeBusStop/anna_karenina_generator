# Anna Karenina Generator ðŸ“š
## Project Overview
In this project, we build a character-wise Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on the text from "Anna Karenina," one of the greatest novels ever written by Leo Tolstoy. The RNN uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture and is capable of generating new text that mimics the style and tone of the original book.

## Features
1. Character-wise text generation
1. Use of LSTM for learning long-term dependencies
1. Trained on Leo Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina"
1. Capable of generating text of variable length

## Customizations
You can adjust the following parameters for customization:

1. `checkpoint`: The checkpoint in training used to generate text.
1. `n_samples`: The number of characters to generate.
1. `lstm_size`: The number of LSTM nodes.
1. `vocab_size`: The the number of unique tokens in the vocabulary.

## Future Improvements
1. Implementing attention mechanisms
1. Introducing more easy hyperparameter tuning options
